This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and selecting multiple images.  The returned assets array contains URIs that point to temporary files. After the app exits and restarts, these files are no longer accessible, leading to broken image displays.  The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.  Sometimes it works as expected; other times it fails.
